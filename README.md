# Real-Time-Distance-Monitoring-and-Motor-Speed-Control-via-MATLAB-and-Arduino-Interfacing
This project presents a real-time sliding door automation system using MATLAB and Arduino. An ultrasonic sensor detects human presence within 50 cm, and based on the distance, MATLAB sends control signals to Arduino to operate a DC motor via an L298N driver.
